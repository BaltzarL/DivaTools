# DivaTools

This is the source code for the Chrome extension for the diva tools script.
Firefox has yet to adopt [Manifest version 3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/) which is why this is not yet compatible with Firefox, altough it could be ported if needed.

Feel free to leave feature requests and issues under the [Issues tab](https://github.com/BaltzarL/DivaTools/issues)

Downloads can be found [here](https://github.com/BaltzarL/DivaTools/releases)
